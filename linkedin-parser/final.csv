The more you handle the flower the greater the potential for bruising/oxidation, hang drying minimizes this. It‚Äôs not difficult to dry cannabis, so removing stem moisture isn‚Äôt an issue it actually slows down the drying time, and as Daryl was saying a slow dry is a good thing. Net drying leads to flat/one sided, and bruised flowers.  Often times it increases the potential for mold on the bottom/flattened side. The only time I recommend net drying is when drying space is limited and even then only for b-buds.",0

Either way it is my job to firmly educate my children on the potential impact they could subject themselves to.,0
